    <p>I was born in 2017 in Accra,Ghana.A few months after
        my birth (when my dad was in China),my mom figured out that I
        could not hear properley.Luckily as time passed I could hear properley.
        By the time I was six(during 2023),we had to travel to Australia.
        When we touched down,I was enrolled into a new school.
        When I turned seven,I embraced to start coding like my dad.
        For my 8th birthday, I got a laptop which I would use for all my
        creations.From the time I was born to were I am now,I want to thank
        God for what he has given me.
