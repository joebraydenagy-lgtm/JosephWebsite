<h1>My three most reccomended and favourite bible stories are:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Joshua,Israel and the Battle of Ai</li>
        <p>A long time ago,the Israelites were fighting with
            Canaan.They also destroyed Ai by ambushing
            them,this is how they did it.There were two groups
            of soldiers.One group would charge at the army of Ai
            whilst the other group waited behind the city.The first
            group will go away from the city with Ai's soldiers pursuing them.Then the
            second group would charge(since no one was in it) at the city and destroy it.This is how
            they did it.</p>
        </p>
        <li>Paul and the Demon-possesed girl</li>
        <p>One day,Paul was in Rome teaching about Jesus.When he was doing 
            that,a girl with a demon in her came to him saying
            "Listen everyone!This one teaches of the Mighty One!".This annoyed
            Paul and he by the power of God,took the spirit out of her.
            All the people got angry and dragged him to court
            were he went to jail.He was taken out eventually and kept preaching
            about the gospel.</p>
        <li>Ehud</li>
        <p>In the land of Israel,the Moabites and the king of Moab(who was very fat) had overrun them because
            of foolishness.One day a left-handed man
            named Ehud(at the time the left hand was considered weak) made a dagger about  two inches wide
            and went to the king of Moab's palace.When he got there,he told
            the king that he had a secret of him.The king told his servants and
            guards to leave.Then with the speed of a cheetah he 
            thrust the dagger into the king's tummy and left immmediatley.
            Then Israel had peace for around forty years.</p>
